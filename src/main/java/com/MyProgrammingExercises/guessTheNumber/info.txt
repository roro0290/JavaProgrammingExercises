Guess-the-Number

1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches, or is higher/lower than the generated number
4.The game continues under the user guessing the number
Further details as:
- Limiting the number of attempts
- Adding more rounds
- Displaying score
- Giving points based on the number of attempts
--> to request for extra clue but the points will be deducted
--> e.g. each attempt = 10 points, each clue = 5 points (lower the number, better the result)

For this project, we will use
1. HTML + CSS to create the interface
- buttons: guess, give up (show the answer), play again (clear the input and generate a new random number)
2. AJAX to send the data to the controller
3. Controller will forward to service
